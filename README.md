# TalkTurbo

TalkTurbo is a lightweight chatbot for Discord that queries the OpenAI GPT 3.5 Turbo model.  TalkTurbo features simple controls for system prompting, context management, response length, and temperature.  It also utilizes the OpenAI Moderation Endpoint to protect your API key from abuse. 

Once TalkTurbo is added to your server you can talk to the bot by @ing it or using the slash commands.  Occasionally TalkTurbo will respond to messages on its own!

## Usage
- Clone this repo and `cd` into it.
- Setup a Discord App+Bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) + aquire the bot's key.  The [Discord.py docs](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html) have a good writeup on this.  
- Aquire an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). 
- Windows:
  - create a `.env` in the `TurboTalk` directory and add the following to it:
    ```
    DISCORD_SECRET_KEY=<discord_secret_key>
    OPENAI_SECRET_KEY=<openai_secret_key>
    ```  
- Linux / MacOS:
    - Export your keys as enviroment vars:
        - `$ export DISCORD_SECRET_KEY=<discord_secret_key>`
        - `$ export OPENAI_SECRET_KEY=<openai_secret_key>`

- Run the bot:
    - Windows: `> python ./src/TurboTalk/turbo.py`
    - Linux / MacOS: `$ python3 ./src/TurboTalk/turbo.py`

## Args

`-h`, `--help` - show this help message and exit
  
`-s`, `--system-prompt` - system prompt to initialize the bot with.
  
`-t`, `--temperature` - sampling temperature, in range [0, 2.0].  A lower temperature will give more deterministic responses.  Default is .7.

`-m` , `--max-response-length` - Max response length in tokens.  Defaults to 100.

## Slash Commands
Slash commands can be used within a Discord server to control the bot.

`/turbo` - talk to turbo!

`/estop` - shut down the bot. use at your discretion if you spot spam, abuse, or other problems. 

`/set_temperature` - set the bots temperature, in range [0, 2.0].

`/set_system_prompt` - set the bot's system prompt

`/clear_context` - clear the bot's context (except for the system prompt)

## Moderation

All system prompts and messages sent to Turbo are routed through the [OpenAI Moderation Endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation). If any of the listed categories return as `true` then the message is not passed along to the gpt model and the user is warned.
